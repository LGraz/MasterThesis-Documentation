  abstract = {It is widely accepted that natural resources should only be sustainably exploited and utilized to effectively preserve our planet for future generations. To better manage the natural resources, and to better understand the closely linked Earth systems, the concept of Digital Earth has been strongly promoted since US Vice President Al Gore's speech in 1998. One core element of Digital Earth is the use and integration of remote sensing data. Only satellite imagery can cover the entire globe repeatedly at a sufficient high-spatial resolution to map changes in land cover and land use, but also to detect more subtle changes related for instance to climate change. To uncover global change effects on vegetation activity and phenology, it is important to establish high quality time series characterizing the past situation against which the current state can be compared. With the present study we describe a time series of vegetation activity at 10-daily time steps between 1998 and 2008 covering large parts of South America at 1 km spatial resolution. Particular emphasis was put on noise removal. Only carefully filtered time series of vegetation indices can be used as a benchmark and for studying vegetation dynamics at a continental scale. Without temporal smoothing, subtle spatio-temporal patterns in vegetation composition, density and phenology would be hidden by atmospheric noise and undetected clouds. Such noise is immanent in data that have undergone solely a maximum value compositing. Within the present study, the Whittaker smoother (WS) was applied to a SPOT VGT time series. The WS balances the fidelity to the observations with the roughness of the smoothed curve. The algorithm is extremely fast, gives continuous control over smoothness with only one parameter, and interpolates automatically. The filtering efficiently removed the negatively biased noise present in the original data, while preserving the overall shape of the curves showing vegetation growth and development. Geostatistical variogram analysis revealed a significantly increased signal-to-noise ratio compared to the raw data. Analysis of the data also revealed spatially consistent key phenological markers. Extracted seasonality parameters followed a clear meridional trend. Compared to the unfiltered data, the filtered time series increased the separability of various land cover classes. It is thus expected that the data set holds great potential for environmental and vegetation related studies within the frame of Digital Earth.},

  abstract = {This study aims at developing a robust and generic methodology, based on the use of high resolution remote sensing data to provide accurate estimates of maize biomass and yield over large areas (i.e. at regional scale). We propose here a strategy of calibration and spatialization independent as much as possible of in situ measurements and reliable over large areas and under various climatic conditions. For this purpose, we combine the Simple Algorithm For Yield estimates (SAFY) model with high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing data from several sensors: Formosat-2, SPOT4-Take5, Landsat-8 and Deimos-1. SPOT4-Take5 experiment conducted in 2013 was designed to simulate the temporal sampling of ESA's Sentinel-2 mission. This study led to a new version of the SAFY model that takes into account the seasonal variation of specific leaf area (SLA) and effective light use efficiency (ELUE). The study takes place in a temperate agrosystem located in the south west of France. The SAFY outputs were validated with local measurements of biomass and yield estimates at both local and regional scales using a multiannual dataset. Good results were obtained for both local biomass (R=0.98; RRMSE=14\%) and yield (R=0.81; RRMSE=8.9\%), and for yield estimations at regional scale (R=0.96; RRMSE=4.6\%). Results also showed that the use of a double logistic function to interpolate Green Area Index (GAI) time series permits to improve the estimations of biomass and yield when remote sensing data are missing. This work demonstrates the potential of high resolution remote sensing data to calibrate a simple crop model without resorting to in situ data and thus foreshadows the future applications using Sentinel-2 data.},

The double logistic functions describe the NDVI data better than both the Fourier series and the asymmetric Gaussian functions, as quantified by the root mean square errors. Compared with the method based on Fourier series, the new method does not overestimate the duration of the growing season. In addition, it handles outliers effectively and estimates parameters that are related to phenological events, such as the timing of spring and autumn.

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148\textendash 156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

  abstract = {Kernel estimators with a global bandwidth are commonly used to estimate regression functions. On the other hand, it is obvious that the choice of a local bandwidth can lead to better results, because a larger class of kernel estimators is available. Evidently, this may in turn affect variability. The optimal bandwidths depend essentially on the regression function itself and on the residual variance, and it is desirable to estimate them from the data. In this article, a local bandwidth estimator is studied. A comparison with its global bandwidth equivalent is performed both in theory and in simulations. As the main result it is shown that the possible gain in mean integrated squared error of the resulting regression estimator must be paid for by a larger variability of the estimator. This may lead to worse results if the sample size is small. An algorithm has been devised that puts special weight on stability aspects. Our simulation study shows that improvements over a global bandwidth estimator often can be realized even at small or moderate sample sizes.},

  abstract = {Many time-series smoothing methods can be used for reducing noise and extracting plant phenological parameters from remotely-sensed data, but there is still no conclusive evidence in favor of one method over others. Here we use moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to investigate five smoothing methods: Savitzky-Golay fitting (SG), locally weighted regression scatterplot smoothing (LO), spline smoothing (SP), asymmetric Gaussian function fitting (AG), and double logistic function fitting (DL). We use ground tower measured NDVI (10 sites) and gross primary productivity (GPP, 4 sites) to evaluate the smoothed satellite-derived NDVI time-series, and elevation data to evaluate phenology parameters derived from smoothed NDVI. The results indicate that all smoothing methods can reduce noise and improve signal quality, but that no single method always performs better than others. Overall, the local filtering methods (SG and LO) can generate very accurate results if smoothing parameters are optimally calibrated. If local calibration cannot be performed, cross validation is a way to automatically determine the smoothing parameter. However, this method may in some cases generate poor fits, and when calibration is not possible the function fitting methods (AG and DL) provide the most robust description of the seasonal dynamics.},

Unfortunately, residual noise in current NDVI time-series products greatly hinders their further applications. Several noise-reduction methods have been proposed during the past two decades, but two important issues remain to be resolved. First, the methods usually perform poorly for cases of continuous missing data in the NDVI time series. Second, they generally assume negatively biased noise in the NDVI time series and thus erroneously raise some local low NDVI values in certain cases (e.g., the harvest period for multi-season crops).We therefore developed a new noise-reduction algorithm called the Spatial-Temporal Savitzky-Golay (STSG) method. The new method assumes discontinuous clouds in space and employs neighboring pixels to assist in the noise reduction of the target pixel in a particular year. The relationship between the NDVI of neighboring pixels and that of the target pixel was obtained from multi-year NDVI time series thanks to the accumulation of NDVI data over many years, which would have been impossible a decade ago. We tested STSG on 16-day composite MODIS NDVI time-series data from 2001 to 2016 in regions of mainland China and 11 phenology camera sites in North American. The results showed that STSG performed significantly better compared with four previous widely used methods (i.e., the Asymmetric Gaussian, Double Logistic, Fourier-based, and Savitzky-Golay filter methods). One obvious advantage was that STSG was able to address the problem of temporally continuous NDVI gaps. STSG effectively increased local low NDVI values and simultaneously avoided overcorrecting low NDVI values during the crop harvest period.

  abstract = {Biomass monitoring, specifically, detecting changes in the biomass or vegetation of a geographical region, is vital for studying the carbon cycle of the system and has significant implications in the context of understanding climate change and its impacts. Recently, several time series change detection methods have been proposed to identify land cover changes in temporal profiles (time series) of vegetation collected using remote sensing instruments. In this paper, we adapt Gaussian process regression to detect changes in such time series in an online fashion. While Gaussian process (GP) has been widely used as a kernel based learning method for regression and classification, their applicability to massive spatio-temporal data sets, such as remote sensing data, has been limited owing to the high computational costs involved. In our previous work we proposed an efficient Toeplitz matrix based solution for scalable GP parameter estimation. In this paper we apply these solutions to a GP based change detection algorithm. The proposed change detection algorithm requires a memory footprint which is linear in the length of the input time series and runs in time which is quadratic to the length of the input time series. Experimental results show that both serial and parallel implementations of our proposed method achieve significant speedups over the serial implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed change detection method in identifying changes in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data.},

Based on the assumptions that NDVI time-series follow annual cycles of growth and decline of vegetation, and that clouds or poor atmospheric conditions usually depress NDVI values, we have developed in the present study a simple but robust method based on the Savitzky\textendash Golay filter to smooth out noise in NDVI time-series, specifically that caused primarily by cloud contamination and atmospheric variability. Our method was developed to make data approach the upper NDVI envelope and to reflect the changes in NDVI patterns via an iteration process. From the results obtained by applying the newly developed method to a 10-day MVC SPOT VGT-S product, we provide optimized parameters for the new method and compare this technique with the BISE algorithm and Fourier-based fitting method. Our results indicate that the new method is more effective in obtaining high-quality NDVI time-series.},

Robust locally weighted regression is a method for smoothing a scatterplot, (x i , y i ), i = 1, \ldots, n, in which the fitted value at z k is the value of a polynomial fit to the data using weighted least squares, where the weight for (x i , y i ) is large if x i is close to x k and small if it is not. A robust fitting procedure is used that guards against deviant points distorting the smoothed points. Visual, computational, and statistical issues of robust locally weighted regression are discussed. Several examples, including data on lead intoxication, are used to illustrate the methodology.},

  abstract = {The assessment of rice yield at territory level is important for strategic economic decisions. Assessing spatial and temporal yield variability at regional scale is difficult because of the numerous factors involved, including agricultural practices, phenological calendars, and environmental contexts. New remote sensing data acquired at decametric resolution (Sentinel missions) can provide information on this spatial variability. The study objective was thus to evaluate the potential of Sentinel-2 images for monitoring rice cropping systems and yield from farm to region scales. The approach considered both observations and modeling. In-depth farmers surveys were carried out in the Camargue region, Southeastern France. The novelty was to use operational tools (BVNET and PHENOTB) to compute leaf area index, to daily interpolate this biophysical variable from 44 images acquired in 2016 and 2017 for each rice field, and to derive key phenological parameters from the analysis of the temporal profiles. The STICS crop model was spatially used, considering the biophysical variables derived from remote sensing. We tested four simulation strategies, differing in the integration intensity of remote sensing information into the model. Results have shown that (1) Sentinel-2 data allowed distinguishing early and late rice varieties. (2) The phenological stages mapped at the regional level allowed to better understand the agricultural practices of farmers. (3) The assimilation of remote sensing data to the STICS crop model significantly improved yield estimation and provided useful information on the spatial variability observed at regional scale. It was the first time that Sentinel-2 data are used with STICS crop model to assess rice yield at both farm and regional scale in the Camargue area. The proposed method is based on free open data and free access model, easily reproducible in other environmental contexts.},

  abstract = {Crop yield maps estimated from satellite data increasingly are used to understand drivers of yield trends and variability, yet satellite-derived regional maps are rarely compared with location-specific yields due to the difficulty of acquiring sub-field ground truth data at scale. In commercial agricultural systems, combine harvesters with onboard yield monitors collect real-time yield data during harvest with high spatial resolution, generating a large ground dataset. Here, we leveraged a yield monitor dataset of over one million maize field observations across the United States Corn Belt from 2008 to 2018 to evaluate the Scalable Crop Yield Mapper (SCYM). SCYM uses region-specific crop model simulations and climate data to interpret vegetation indices from satellite observations, thus enabling efficient sub-field yield estimation across large regions and multiple years without reliance on ground data calibration. We used the ground dataset to compare alternative SCYM model implementations, define minimum required satellite observation criteria, and evaluate the sensitivity of satellite-based yield estimates to on-the-ground variation in management, soil, and annual weather. We found that smoothing annual time series data with harmonic regression increased 30~m pixel-level accuracy from r2~=~0.31 to 0.40 and reduced dependency on specific satellite observation timing, enabling robust yield estimation on 97\% of annual maize area using only Landsat data. Agreement improved as the assessment was aggregated to field-level (r2~=~0.45) and county-level (r2~=~0.69) scales, demonstrating the need for fine-resolution ground truth data to better assess sub-field level accuracy in high resolution products. We found that SCYM and ground data showed a similar yield response to management and environmental variation, particularly capturing linear and nonlinear responses to sowing density, soil water holding capacity, and growing season precipitation. However, sensitivity to factors like soil quality and planting date was muted for SCYM estimates compared to ground-based yields. Random forest models were able to match SCYM performance when trained on at least 1000 ground observations, but performed poorly when tested on years and locations not represented in the training data. Our results demonstrate that satellite yield maps can provide much-needed information on multidecadal yield trends and inform yield gap analyses.},

  abstract = {In Chapters 5 and 6 we discussed geostatistical inference from a classical or non-Bayesian perspective, treating parameter estimation and prediction as separate problems. We did this for two reasons, one philosophical the other practical. Firstly, in the non-Bayesian setting, there is a fundamental distinction between a parameter and a prediction target. A parameter has a fixed, but unknown value which represents a property of the processes which generate the data, whereas a prediction target is the realised value of a random variable associated with those same processes. Secondly, estimation and prediction are usually operationally separate in geostatistical practice, meaning that we first formulate our model and estimate its parameters, then plug the estimated parameter values into theoretical prediction equations as if they were the true values. An obvious concern with this two-phase approach is that ignoring uncertainty in the parameter estimates may lead to optimistic assessments of predictive accuracy. It is possible to address this concern in various ways without being Bayesian, but in our view the Bayesian approach gives a more elegant solution, and it is the one which we have adopted in our own work.},

We use the description "classical" in two different senses: firstly, as a reference to the variogram-based methods of estimation which are widely used in classical geostatistics as developed by the Fontainebleau school; secondly, within mainstream statistical methodology as a synonym for non-Bayesian. The chapter has a strong focus on the linear Gaussian model. This is partly because the Gaussian model is, from our perspective, implicit in much of classical geostatistical methodology, and partly because model-based estimation methods are most easily implemented in the linear Gaussian case. We discuss non-Bayesian estimation for generalized linear geostatistical models in Section 5.5, indicating in particular why maximum likelihood estimation is feasible in principle, but difficult to implement in practice.},

  abstract = {Gaussian stochastic processes are widely used in practice as models for geostatistical data. These models rarely have any physical justification. Rather, they are used as convenient empirical models which can capture a wide range of spatial behaviour according to the specification of their correlation structure. Historically, one very good reason for concentrating on Gaussian models was that they are uniquely tractable as models for dependent data. With the increasing use of computationally intensive methods, and in particular of simulation-based methods of inference, the analytic tractability of Gaussian models is becoming a less compelling reason to use them. Nevertheless, it is still convenient to work within a standard model class in routine applications. The scope of the Gaussian model class can be extended by using a transformation of the original response variable, and with this extra flexibility the model often provides a good empirical fit to data. Also, within the specific context of geostatistics, the Gaussian assumption is the model-based counterpart of some widely used geostatistical prediction methods, including simple, ordinary and universal kriging (Journel and Huijbregts, 1978; Chil\`es and Delfiner, 1999). We shall use the Gaussian model initially as a model in its own right for geostatistical data with a continuously varying response, and later as an important component of a hierarchically specified generalised linear model for geostatistical data with a discrete response variable, as previously discussed in Section 1.4.},

  abstract = {Vegetation indices derived from remote sensing data provide information about the variability in stature, growth and vigor of the vegetation across a region, and have been used to model plant processes. For example, the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) provides a measure of greenness of the vegetation that can be used to predict net primary production. However, ecosystem models relying on remote sensing data for EVI or other vegetation indices are limited by the time series of the satellite data record. Our objective was to develop a statistical model to predict EVI in order to extend the time series for modeling applications. To explain the functional behavior of the seasonal EVI curves, a two-stage multiple regression fitting procedure within a semi-parametric mixed effect (SPME) model framework was used. First, a linear mixed effect (LME) model was fitted to the EVI with climate indexes, crop and irrigation information as predictor variables. Second, Penalized B-splines were used to explain the behavior of the smooth residuals, which result from a smooth model fit to the smooth EVI data curve, in order to describe the uncertainty of the EVI curve. Individual models were fit within individual Major Land Resources Areas (MLRAs). Predicted seasonal EVI, derived from our regression equations, showed a strong agreement with the observed EVI and was able to capture the site by site and year by year variation in the EVI curve. Out-of-sample prediction produced excellent results for a majority of the sites, except for sites without clear seasonal patterns, which may have resulted from cloud contamination and/or snow cover. Therefore, given the appropriate climate, crop, and irrigation information, the proposed approach can be used to predict seasonal EVI curves for extending the time series into the past and future.},

In fact, these models generalize the whole family of generalized linear models {$\eta$}(x) = {$\beta{'}$}x, where {$\eta$}(x) = g({$\mu$}(x)) is some transformation of the regression function. We use the local scoring algorithm to estimate the functions fj (xj ) nonparametrically, using a scatterplot smoother as a building block. We demonstrate the models in two different analyses: a nonparametric analysis of covariance and a logistic regression. The procedure can be used as a diagnostic tool for identifying parametric transformations of the covariates in a standard linear analysis. A variety of inferential tools have been developed to aid the analyst in assessing the relevance and significance of the estimated functions: these include confidence curves, degrees of freedom estimates, and approximate hypothesis tests. The local scoring algorithm is analogous to the iterative reweighted least squares algorithm for solving likelihood and nonlinear regression equations. At each iteration, an adjusted dependent variable is formed and an additive regression model is fit using the backfitting algorithm. The backfitting algorithm cycles through the variables and estimates each coordinated function by smoothing the partial residuals.},

Sentinel-2 satellite imagery is a promising data source and paying agencies are encouraged to test their pre-operational use. Here, we present the outcome of the Hungarian agricultural subsidy monitoring pilot: our goal was to propose a solution based on open-source components and evaluate the main strengths and weaknesses for Sentinel-2 in the framework of a complex set of tasks. These include the checking of the basic cultivation of grasslands and arable land and compliance to the criteria of ecological focus areas. The processing of the satellite data was conducted based on random forest for crop classification and the detection of cultivation events was conducted based on NDVI (Normalized Differential Vegetation Index) time series analysis results. The outputs of these processes were combined in a decision tree ruleset to provide the final results. We found that crop classification provided good performance (overall accuracy 88\%) for 22 vegetation classes and cultivation detection was also reliable when compared to on-screen visual interpretation. The main limitation was the size of fields, which were frequently small compared to the spatial resolution of the images: more than 4\% of the parcels had to be excluded, although these represent less than 3\% of the cultivated area of Hungary. Based on these results, we find that operational satellite-based monitoring is feasible for Hungary, and expect further improvements from integration with Sentinel-1 due to additional temporal resolution.},

  abstract = {Plant trait data have been used in various studies related to ecosystem functioning, community ecology, and assessment of ecosystem services. Evidences are that plant scientists agree on a set of key plant traits, which are relatively easy to measure and have a stable and strong predictive response to ecosystem functions. However, the field measurements of plant trait data are still limited to small area, to a certain moment in time and to certain number of species only. Therefore, remote sensing (RS) offers potential to complement or even replace field measurements of some plant traits. It offers instantaneous spatially contiguous information, covers larger areas and in case of satellite observations profits from their revisit capacity. In this review, we first introduce RS concepts of light\textendash vegetation interactions, RS instruments for vegetation studies, RS methods, and scaling between field and RS observations. Further we discuss in detail current achievements and challenges of optical RS for mapping of key plant traits. We concentrate our discussion on three categorical plant traits (plant growth and life forms, flammability properties and photosynthetic pathways and activity) and on five continuous plant traits (plant height, leaf phenology, leaf mass per area, nitrogen and phosphorous concentration or content). We review existing literature to determine the retrieval accuracy of the continuous plant traits. The relative estimation error using RS ranged between 10\% and 45\% of measured mean value, i.e. around 10\% for plant height of tall canopies, 20\% for plant height of short canopies, 15\% for plant nitrogen, 25\% for plant phosphorus content/concentration, and 45\% for leaf mass per area estimates. The potential of RS to map plant traits is particularly high when traits are related to leaf biochemistry, photosynthetic processes and canopy structure. There are also other plant traits, i.e. leaf chlorophyll content, water content and leaf area index, which can be retrieved from optical RS well and can be of importance for plant scientists. We underline the need that future assessments of ecosystem functioning using RS should require comprehensive and integrated measurements of various plant traits together with leaf and canopy spectral properties. By doing so, the interplay between plant structural, physiological, biochemical, phenological and spectral properties can be better understood.},

  abstract = {Accurate crop yield estimates are important for governments, farmers, scientists and agribusiness. This paper provides a novel demonstration of the use of freely available Sentinel-2 data to estimate within-field wheat yield variability in a single year. The impact of data resolution and availability on yield estimation is explored using different combinations of input data. This was achieved by combining Sentinel-2 with environmental data (e.g. meteorological, topographical, soil moisture) for different periods throughout the growing season. Yield was estimated using Random Forest (RF) regression models. They were trained and validated using a dataset containing over 8000 points collected by combine harvester yield monitors from 39 wheat fields in the UK. The results demonstrate that it is possible to produce accurate maps of within-field yield variation at 10\,m resolution using Sentinel-2 data (RMSE 0.66\,t/ha). When combined with environmental data further improvements in accuracy can be obtained (RMSE 0.61\,t/ha). We demonstrate that with knowledge of crop-type distribution it is possible to use these models, trained with data from a few fields, to estimate within-field yield variability on a landscape scale. Applying this method gives us a range of crop yield across the landscape of 4.09 to 12.22\,t/ha, with a total crop production of approx. 289,000\,t.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing is a convenient method for plant monitoring by employing vegetation variables which is changed dynamically in time and space. Furthermore, in the last few decades the number and quality of information that can be derived from remotely sensed images is rapidly increased. The widespread usage of information from satellite-born sensors provides a new tool for studying the biophysical properties of vegetation by mapping vegetation resources and changes that arise over extended periods of time. The European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2 mission, as a part of the European Global Monitoring for Environment (GMES) initiative, is a polar-orbiting, superspectral high resolution imaging mission that envisaged flying a pair of satellites; the first planned to launch in 2013. The Sentinel-2 mission combine a large swath, frequent revisit and systematic acquisition of high-spatial resolution land surfaces imagery with a large number of spectral bands; that will provide accurate and easily accessible data for the environmental management. The most important impact of Sentinel-2 for plant monitoring is expected to be the improved plant parameters: Fraction of Vegetation Cover (FVC), Leaf Area Index (LAI), Leaf Chlorophyll Content (Cab), Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) and Leaf Water Content (Cw); by incorporating three new spectral bands in the red-edge region, which are centered at 705, 740 and 783 nm. The goal is to improve site-specific plant management by the retrieving different plant parameters as an input for management measures aimed to non-destructive monitoring of plant development and the detection of many environmental stresses, which can limit plant productivity.},

  abstract = {Closing the yield gap between actual and potential wheat yields in Australia is important to meet the growing global demand for food. The identification of hotspots of the yield gap, where the potential for improvement is the greatest, is a necessary step towards this goal. While crop growth models are well suited to quantify potential yields, they lack the ability to provide accurate large-scale estimates of actual yields, owing to the sheer quantity of data they require for parameterisation. In this context, we sought to provide accurate estimates of actual wheat yields across the Australian wheat belt based on machine-learning regression methods, climate records and satellite image time series. Out of nine base learners and two ensembles, support vector regression with radial basis function emerged as the single best learner (root mean square error of 0.55\,t\,ha-1 and R2 of 0.77 at the pixel level). At national scale, this model explained 73\% of the yield variability observed across statistical units. Benchmark approaches based on peak Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and on a harvest index were largely outperformed by the machine-learning regression models (R2\,{$<$}\,0.46). Climate variables such as maximum temperatures and accumulated rainfall provided additional information to the 16-day NDVI time series as they significantly improved yield predictions. Variables observed up to and around the flowering period had a particularly high predictive power with additional information gained from data during grain filling. We further showed that, while all models were sensitive to a reduction of the training set size, a large majority had not reached saturation with a data set of 125 fields (2000\,pixels). This indicates that additional training data are likely to further improve the skill of the models. We estimated that observations from 75 fields (1200\,pixels) are required for the best single model to reach an R2 of 0.7. We contend that machine-learning regression methods applied to climate and satellite image time series can achieve reliable crop yield monitoring across years at both the pixel and the country scale. The resulting yield estimates meet the accuracy requirements for mapping the yield gap and identifying yield gap hotspots which could be targeted for further work by agricultural researchers and advisers.},

As a result, our goal is to recapitulate the current approaches for reconstructing high-quality NDVI time series, followed by an interpretation on the principle, merits and demerits of different kinds of methods. They were mainly classified into temporal-based methods, frequency-based methods and hybrid methods.

  abstract = {Heat units, expressed in growing degree-days (GDD), are frequently used to describe the timing of biological processes. The basic equation used is GDD = [(TMAX + TMIN)2]-TBASE, where TMAX and TMIN are daily maximum and minimum air temperature, respectively, and TBASE is the base temperature. Two methods of interpreting this equation for calculating GDD are: (1) if the daily mean temperature is less than the base, it is set equal to the base temperature, or (2) if TMAX or TMIN {$<$} TBASE they are reset equal to TBASE. The objective of this paper is to show the differences which can result from using these two methods to estimate GDD, and make researchers and practitioners aware of the need to report clearly which method was used in the calculations. Although percent difference between methods of calculation are dependent on TMAX and TMIN data used to compute GDD, our comparisons have produced differences up to 83\% when using a 0\textdegree C base for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Greater differences were found for corn (Zea mays L.) when using a base temperature of 10\textdegree C. Differences between the methods occur if only TMIN is less than TBASE, and then Method 1 accumulates fewer GDD than Method 2. When incorporating an upper threshold, as commonly done with corn, there was a greater difference between the two methods. Not recognizing the discrepancy between methods can result in confusion and add error in quantifying relationships between heat unit accumulation and timing of events in crop development and growth, particularly in crop simulation models. This paper demonstrates the need for authors to clearly communicate the method of calculating GDD so others can correctly interpret and apply reported results.},

During the dry season, the delta's coastal zone experiences saline water intrusion due to its low-lying topography. On May 2, 2008, Cyclone Nargis made landfall and crossed Ayeyarwady Region and Yangon City, affecting more than 50 townships and causing massive destruction of personal property and natural ecosystems. There is no doubt that Nargis caused an unprecedented large-scale disaster, but there is no objective method to quantify crop yield and salinity damage in the delta post-Nargis. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to clarify the changes in vegetation in paddy fields in the Ayeyarwady Delta using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data pre- and post-Nargis and determine whether this method can be applied to measure crop and salinity damage. The study used daily composite data at a 250-m resolution (MOD09GQ, collection 6) from 2004 to 2013 and calculated NDVI and salinity indices smoothed by locally weighted regression (Lowess). Based on the results of our studies, NDVI peak value in 2008 was lower by 19\% compared to 2007 data, and that the NDVI peak values declined for three straight years since May 2008 when Nargis struck. However, salinity damage evaluation pre- and post-Nargis (using the salinity index equation) showed that soil electrical conductivity did not tend to move up in the post-Nargis dry season (2009), indicating that the decrease in NDVI values was not due to salinity damage.},

In a second stage, we focus on the longitudinal modelling of the spatially corrected data, thereby taking advantage of shared longitudinal features between genotypes and plants within genotypes. We propose a flexible hierarchical three-level P-spline growth curve model, with plants/plots nested in genotypes, and genotypes nested in populations. For selection of genotypes in a plant breeding context, we show how to extract new phenotypes, like growth rates, from the estimated genotypic growth curves and their first-order derivatives.

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) is one of the key nutrients supplied in agricultural production worldwide. Over-fertilization can have negative influences on the field and the regional level (e.g., agro-ecosystems). Remote sensing of the plant N of field crops presents a valuable tool for the monitoring of N flows in agro-ecosystems. Available data for validation of satellite-based remote sensing of N is scarce. Therefore, in this study, field spectrometer measurements were used to simulate data of the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites developed for vegetation monitoring by the ESA. The prediction performance of normalized ratio indices (NRIs), random forest regression (RFR) and Gaussian processes regression (GPR) for plant-N-related traits was assessed on a diverse real-world dataset including multiple crops, field sites and years. The plant N traits included the mass-based N measure, N concentration in the biomass (Nconc), and an area-based N measure approximating the plant N uptake (NUP). Spectral indices such as normalized ratio indices (NRIs) performed well, but the RFR and GPR methods outperformed the NRIs. Key spectral bands for each trait were identified using the RFR variable importance measure and the Gaussian processes regression band analysis tool (GPR-BAT), highlighting the importance of the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region for estimation of plant Nconc\textemdash and to a lesser extent the NUP. The red edge (RE) region was also important. The GPR-BAT showed that five bands were sufficient for plant N trait and leaf area index (LAI) estimation and that a surplus of bands effectively reduced prediction performance. A global sensitivity analysis (GSA) was performed on all traits simultaneously, showing the dominance of the LAI in the mixed remote sensing signal. To delineate the plant-N-related traits from this signal, regional and/or national data collection campaigns producing large crop spectral libraries (CSL) are needed. An improved database will likely enable the mapping of N at the agro-ecosystem level or for use in precision farming by farmers in the future.},

  abstract = {Given the continuous increase in the global population, the food manufacturers are advocated to either intensify the use of cropland or expand the farmland, making land cover and land usage dynamics mapping vital in the area of remote sensing. In this regard, identifying and classifying a high-resolution satellite imagery scene is a prime challenge. Several approaches have been proposed either by using static rule-based thresholds (with limitation of diversity) or neural network (with data-dependent limitations). This paper adopts the inductive approach to learning from surface reflectances. A manually labeled Sentinel-2 dataset was used to build a Machine Learning (ML) model for scene classification, distinguishing six classes (Water, Shadow, Cirrus, Cloud, Snow, and Other). This models was accessed and further compared to the European Space Agency (ESA) Sen2Cor package. The proposed ML model presents a Micro-F1 value of 0.84, a considerable improvement when compared to the Sen2Cor corresponding performance of 0.59. Focusing on the problem of optical satellite image scene classification, the main research contributions of this paper are: (a) an extended manually labeled Sentinel-2 database adding surface reflectance values to an existing dataset; (b) an ensemble-based and a Neural-Network-based ML models; (c) an evaluation of model sensitivity, biasness, and diverse ability in classifying multiple classes over different geographic Sentinel-2 imagery, and finally, (d) the benchmarking of the ML approach against the Sen2Cor package.},

Consequently, ERTS-1 data provide a new tool for monitoring range readiness on a regional basis. The onset of summer drought and its duration can also be monitored.

In contrast to most discussions of S-G filters, they focused on the frequency domain properties, and offered an approximate formula for the 3-dB cutoff frequency as a function of polynomial order N and impulse response half length M. Engineers with a frequency domain mindset may find this useful if they choose to use S-G filters in their application.},

  abstract = {A combination of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 offers a high frequency of observations (3\textendash 5 days) at moderate spatial resolution (10\textendash 30 m), which is essential for crop yield studies. Existing methods traditionally apply vegetation indices (VIs) that incorporate surface reflectances (SRs) in two or more spectral bands into a single variable, and rarely address the incorporation of SRs into empirical regression models of crop yield. In this work, we address these issues by normalizing satellite data (both VIs and SRs) derived from NASA's Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) product, through a phenological fitting. We apply a quadratic function to fit VIs or SRs against accumulated growing degree days (AGDDs), which affects the rate of crop development. The derived phenological metrics for VIs and SRs, namely peak, area under curve (AUC), and fitting coefficients from a quadratic function, were used to build empirical regression winter wheat models at a regional scale in Ukraine for three years, 2016\textendash 2018. The best results were achieved for the model with near infrared (NIR) and red spectral bands and derived AUC, constant, linear, and quadratic coefficients of the quadratic model. The best model yielded a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.201 t/ha (5.4\%) and coefficient of determination R2 = 0.73 on cross-validation.},

The analysis of time-series from this dataset reveals, for the years 1982\textendash 2001, strong seasonal and interannual variability in European land surface vegetation state. Phenological metrics indicate a late and short growing season for the years 1985\textendash 1987, in addition to early and prolonged activity in the years 1989, 1990, 1994 and 1995. These variations are in close agreement with findings from phenological measurements at the surface; spring phenology is also shown to correlate particularly well with anomalies in winter temperature and winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. Nevertheless, phenological metrics, which display considerable regional differences, could only be determined for vegetation with a seasonal behaviour. Trends in the phenological phases reveal a general shift to earlier (-0.54 days year-1) and prolonged (0.96 days year-1) growing periods which are statistically significant, especially for central Europe.},

The study was conducted on a historic public park in Vr\v{s}ac (Serbia), which is an important Serbian national heritage site. After comparing recordings from 14 weather stations in the region with recordings from the City Park, the weather station in Vrsac was chosen. The daily averaged values of climatic data for March, June, July and October of each year between 1949 and 2016, were used to compute the daily reference evapotranspiration ETl (mm/day), according to the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation. A landscape coefficient was estimated through field monitoring based on the Water Use Classification of Landscape Species (WUCOLS) principles. Also, thermal infrared images from Landsat 8 and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the QuickBird Satellite data are used as the remote sensing inputs to model daily evapotranspiration. This research explored the relationship between urban vegetation ETl computed by the FAO-56 PenmanMonteith method with the required meteorological data and by means of the remote sensing. The analysis revealed the significant correlation between the average daily evapotranspiration estimates from 0.98 to 0.99 by the Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression and the weak Spearman's Rank correlation (r ranges from -0.006 to 0.384) leading to the conclusion that the Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression is more suitable for evaluating urban landscape water requirements.},

The primary objectives were: (1) crop biophysical modeling through HNBs and HVIs, (2) accuracy assessment of crop type discrimination using Wilks' Lambda through a discriminant model, and (3) meta-analysis to select optimal HNBs and HVIs for applications related to agriculture. The study was conducted using two Earth Observing One (EO-1) Hyperion scenes and other surface hyperspectral data for the eight leading worldwide crops (wheat, corn, rice, barley, soybeans, pulses, cotton, and alfalfa) that occupy \$\textbackslash sim \$70\% of all cropland areas globally. This study integrated data collected from multiple study areas in various agroecosystems of Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and India. Data were collected for the eight crop types in six distinct growth stages. These included (a) field spectroradiometer measurements (350\textendash 2500 nm) sampled at 1-nm discrete bandwidths, and (b) field biophysical variables (e.g., biomass, leaf area index) acquired to correspond with spectroradiometer measurements. The eight crops were described and classified using \$\textbackslash sim \$20 HNBs. The accuracy of classifying these 8 crops using HNBs was around 95\%, which was \$\textbackslash sim \$25\% better than the multi-spectral results possible from Landsat-7's Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ or EO-1's Advanced Land Imager. Further, based on this research and meta-analysis involving over 100 papers, the study established 33 optimal HNBs and an equal number of specific two-band normalized difference HVIs to best model and study specific biophysical and biochemical quantities of major agricultural crops of the world. Redundant bands identified in this study will help overcome the Hughes Phenomenon (or ``the curse of high dimensionality'') in hyperspectral data for a particular application (e.g., biophysical characterization of crops). The findings of this study will make a significant contribution to future hyperspectral missions such as NASA's HyspIRI.},

The EC-LUE model can explain on average approximately 90\% of the variability in GPP for 36 FLUXNET sites globally. The results indicate that a universal set of parameters, independent of crop species (except for C4 crops), can be adopted in the EC-LUE model for simulating crops' GPP. At both irrigated and rainfed sites, the EC-LUE model exhibits a similar level of performance. However, large errors are found when simulating yield based on crop harvest index. This analysis highlights the need to improve the representation of the harvest index and carbon allocation for improving crop yield estimations from satellite-based methods.},
