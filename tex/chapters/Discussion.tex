\textbf{High RMSE in ...:} How much can we expect to get? We have multiple sources of uncertainty in the data:
1. Uncertainty in Yield data collected by the combine harverster
2. Uncertainty in Yield data through rasterization
3. Uncertainty in satellite images through ``measurement errors'' introduced via clouds and other atmospheric effects 
4. Uncertainty introduced by interpolating (especially when long data-gaps are present)
