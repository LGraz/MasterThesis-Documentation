\section{Goodness of Fit for Selected Interpolation Methods}{
	\label{sec:results_itpl}
	Table \ref{tab:cv-statistics_itpl-methods} benchmarks the selected\footnote{\label{note:selected-IM} For the discussion which methods have been selected cf. section \ref{sec:itpl_preselection}.} interpolation methods (on $P^{SCL45}$) with respect to various score functions. The score functions take the absolute values of the LOOCV residuals and summarize them in a number (the smaller, the better). For each of the 5 selected interpolation methods, we consider the basic and the robustified (see section \ref{sec:loess_robustify}) version.

	DL is the best among both robustified and non-robustified with respect to most of the score functions used (all except q95) and is especially superior to the other parametric approach, which is FS. Especially the robust FS performs poorly. The LOESS dominates (i.e., is superior on every score function) all other non-prametric methods, but is closely followed by the SS. The BSPL, on the other hand, is the worst non-parametric method tested here.

\section{XXX (Robustification and) NDVI-Correction} \label{sec:results_ndvi_corr}
\todo[inline]{defiition of RYEA, it is not an accuracy but an error}
	The RYEA for the 28 (in section \ref{sec:corr_itpl_stat}) chosen interpolation strategies is given in table \ref{tab:methods_vs_yieldprediction_relative}. 

	\begin{table}
		\begin{center}
			\caption{RYEA. For the non-relative RMSE and the coefficient of determination (R\textsuperscript{2}) see table \ref{tab:methods_vs_yieldprediction} and \ref{tab:methods_vs_yieldprediction_r2}.}

	\end{table}

	Robustification in the interpolation strategies, does not improve the quality of the fit (measured via the RYEA) in most cases. 
	In addition, SS (rob) are better than DL(rob) in terms of RYEA, with one exception.
	
	The interpolation strategy that leads to the lowest RYEA is the OLS-SCL with SS. Given that the OLS-SCL models have very good interpretability, we also present the regression equations below. The corrected NDVI is calculated using 
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:corr_lm}
		\begin{aligned}		
			{\operatorname{NDVI}}_{\text{corr}}  = &
			0.711 \operatorname{NDVI}_\text{observed}  
			+ \mathbbm 1_{{SCL = 2}} 0.215 
			+ \mathbbm 1_{{SCL = 3}} 0.237 
			+ \mathbbm 1_{{SCL = 4}} 0.210 \\ &
			+ \mathbbm 1_{{SCL = 5}} 0.116 
			+ \mathbbm 1_{{SCL = 6}} 0.162 
			+ \mathbbm 1_{{SCL = 7}} 0.327 
			+ \mathbbm 1_{{SCL = 8}} 0.474 \\ &
			+ \mathbbm 1_{{SCL = 9}} 0.575 
			+ \mathbbm 1_{{SCL = 10}} 0.306 
			+ \mathbbm 1_{{SCL = 11}} 0.512 
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation} 
	where $\mathbbm 1_{{SCL = 2}}$ is equal to one if the current observation corresponds to SCL class 2 and zero otherwise.\footnote{$\mathbbm 1$ is also called an indicator function or characteristic function in mathematics.}. Whereas, we obtain the estimated absolute residuals by: 
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:corr_lm_res}
		\begin{aligned}		
			\widehat{\operatorname{abs}}\left({\operatorname{NDVI}_\text{``true''} - \operatorname{NDVI}}_{\text{corr}}\right)  = &
			-0.133 \operatorname{NDVI}_\text{observed}  
			+ \mathbbm 1_{{SCL = 2}} 0.186 
			+ \mathbbm 1_{{SCL = 3}} 0.185 \\ &
			+ \mathbbm 1_{{SCL = 4}} 0.146 
			+ \mathbbm 1_{{SCL = 5}} 0.089 
			+ \mathbbm 1_{{SCL = 6}} 0.167 \\ &
			+ \mathbbm 1_{{SCL = 7}} 0.203 
			+ \mathbbm 1_{{SCL = 8}} 0.181  
			+ \mathbbm 1_{{SCL = 9}} 0.173 \\ &
			+ \mathbbm 1_{{SCL = 10}} 0.180 
			+ \mathbbm 1_{{SCL = 11}} 0.172 
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation} 
	In the equation \refeq{eq:corr_lm}, we notice the strongest upwards correction for SCL classes 8, 9 and 11 (correspond to `medium probability clouds', `high probability clouds' and `thin cirrus clouds'). The estimated absolute resiudas, however, are the smallest for SCL classes 4 and 5 (`vegetation' and `bare soil'). Furthermore, the higher the observed NDVI the lower are the estimated absolute residuals.

	For the \texttt{R}-output of the \texttt{summary} function of the two models, we refer to the appendix \ref{app:ols-scl-summary}.
