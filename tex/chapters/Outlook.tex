\section{Data}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Method how data has been extrapolated to the grid could possibly be improved
    \item For computational reasons we mostly considered all years and split the data (on the pixel level) randomly into a train/test set. A cross Validation with leaving one year out would be 
\end{itemize}    

\section{Interpolation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Penalized Regressions as described in ... are similar to smoothing splines (c.f. ...) but different. Better?
\end{itemize}    

\section{NDVI Correction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item try different link functions in section ... between estimated absolute resiudals and weights
\end{itemize}    


\section{NDVI Correction + +}
\begin{itemize}
    \item NDVI Correction can be applied to all sorts of land observed via. satellites (without the need of ground truth data)
    \item The idea of NDVI Correction could be applied to other spectral indices like the Green Leaf Area Index.
    \item Yield is not the only target variable of interest. Other variables like protein content could also be used in section ... for the method evaluation. 
\end{itemize}
