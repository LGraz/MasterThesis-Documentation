Since this thesis, despite its applied nature, is located at the Mathematics Department, we adhere to the convention of speaking in the first-person plural `we'.\\
Furthermore, only equations that are referenced elsewhere are equipped with a number.

\section*{Abbreviations and Objects}\vspace{-0.2cm}
\begin{longtable}{p{0.12\linewidth} p{0.87\linewidth}}
	DAS       & Days After Sowing.\\
	GDD       & Growing Degree Days -- cumulative sum of temperature (see. section~\ref{sec:gdd_def}).\\
	IM       & Interpolation Method. That is a  method that interpolates data $(t_i,y_i)_{i = 1,\dots ,n}$ and returns a function $f(t)=y$, approximating the data.\\
	IS       & Interpolation Strategy. By combining various correction models with different IMs (with and without robustification) in section~\ref{sec:corr_itpl_stat} 28 ISs were obtained.\\% This is the category of functions that map $(t_i,y_i)_{i=1,\dots,n}$ to a function $f(t)=y$, approximating the data. So a IS describes a strategy of how to arrive at an interpolation starting from the data $(t_i,y_i)_{i=1,\dots,n}$. For this, initial data may be corrected (cf. chapter~\ref{sec:corr}), (possible different) IMs (iteratively) used, weightings applied (cf. robustification in section~\ref{sec:loess_robustify}). Note, that strictly speaking, every IM also is an IS. But usually, we expect an IS to involve a more `complex' procedure.\\
	LOOCV        & Leave One Out Cross Validation. Describes the procedure of estimating the value for a point by a model that has seen all the points except the current one (see section~\ref{sec:OOB_LOOCV}).\\
	NDVI       & Normalized Difference Vegetation Index \citep{rouseMonitoringVernalAdvancement1974}.\\
	OOB        & Out Of the Box. Describes the procedure of  estimating the value for a point by a model that has not seen this point before (see section~\ref{sec:OOB_LOOCV}).\\
	Pixel       & A data structure that originates from an image pixel and describes a square of $10\times 10$ meters in the field that coincides with the resolution (and location) of the Sentinel-2 pixels. Such pixels are illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:satelite/witzwil_2021_P112_yield_cropped.png}. Additional information like yield is also attached.\\
	$P_t$       & The observed data (weather and spectral bands) at time $t$ and the location of one pixel.\\
	$P$       & A pixel. We see it as a collection of all the observations at the specified location within one season. More formally, $P := \left\{P_t | t\text{ is a valid sample time within a defined season}\right\}$.\\
    %	$P^{SCL45}$       & is similar to $P$ but we only consider observations that belong to the classes 4 and 5. This is used done to get a subset of observations which are less contaminated by clouds and shadows.\\
    QAR\textsuperscript{x}       & x\% Quantile of Absolute Residuals  (see definition~\ref{def:qar}).\\
	RMSE         & Root Mean Square Error (see definition~\ref{def:rmse}).\\
	S2       & Sentinel 2 satellites. Two multi-spectral image satellites deployed by the European Space Agency.\\
	SCL       & Scene Classification Layer provided by the European Space Agency that gives an estimation of the land cover class of each pixel. It indicates what one can expect at a pixel at a sampled time. For an overview, see table~\ref{tab:satelite/scl_classes}.\\
	TS       & Time Series.\\
	YPE        & (Relative) Yield Prediction Error (see definition~\ref{def:YPE}).\\
