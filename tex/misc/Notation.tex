\label{c:Notation}

$c$: a (vector of) constant(s)

$\lambda \in \R$: a scalar

$n\in \N$: sample size

$i,j$ are indices in $\{1,\dots,n\}$

$x\in \R^n$: covariable in 1-dim interpolation setting

$w \in \R^n$: a vector of weights for each location $x$

$y\in \R^n$: response in 1-dim interpolation setting

$\hat y\in \R^n$: estimate of $y$

$r \in \R^n$: residuals given by $y - \hat y$

Pixel: A Pixel describes a specific location in a field. It has the size of 10 x 10 meters and coincides with the resolution (and location) of the sentinel-2 pixels. Such pixels are illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:satelite/yield-raster}.

NDVI: normalized vegetation difference index

DAS: days after sowing

GDD: growing degree days -- cumulative sum of ($\text{temperature}-\text{threshold})^+$

SCL: scene classification layer. This indicates what one can expect at a pixel at a sampled time. For an overview c.f. table~\ref{table:satelite/scl_classes}
