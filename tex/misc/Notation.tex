\section*{Abbreviations and Objects}
\begin{longtable}{p{0.12\linewidth} p{0.87\linewidth}}
TS	
		& Time Series. \\
S2	
		& Sentinel 2 satellites. Two multi-spectral image satellites deployed by the European Space Agency. \\
SCL	
		& Scene Classification Layer provided by the European Space Agency that gives an estimation of the land cover class of each pixel. It indicates what one can expect at a pixel at a sampled time. For an overview, see table~\ref{tab:satelite/scl_classes}\\
Pixel	
		& A pixel originates of an image pixel and describes a square of 10 x 10 meters in the field that coincides with the resolution (and location) of the Sentinel-2 pixels. Such pixels are illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:satelite/witzwil_2021_P112_yield_cropped.png}. Additional information like yield is also attached.\\

$P_t$	
		& the observed data (weather and spectral bands) at time $t$ and the location of one pixel. \\

$P$	
		& a pixel. We see it as a collection of all the observations at the specified location within one season. More formally, $P := \left\{P_t | t\text{ is a valid sample time within a defined season}\right\}$\\


$P^{SCL45}$	
		& is similar to $P$ but we only consider observations that belong to the classes 4 and 5. This is used done to get a subset of observations which are less contaminated by clouds and shadows.\\

NDVI	
		& Normalized Difference Vegetation Index \citep{rouseMonitoringVernalAdvancement1974}\\

DAS	
		& Days After Sowing\\

GDD	
		& Growing Degree Days -- cumulative sum of ``$\max(0, \text{temperature}-\text{threshold})$''\\

RYEA 	
		& Relative Yield-Estimation-Accuracy. Definition \ref{def:ryea}\\

OOB 	
		& Out Of the Box. Describes the procedure of  estimating the value for a point by a model that has not seen this point before (see section \ref{sec:OOB_LOOCV}).\\

LOOCV 	
		& Leave One Out Cross Validation. Describes the procedure of estimating the value for a point by a model that has seen all the points except the current one (see section \ref{sec:OOB_LOOCV}).\\
